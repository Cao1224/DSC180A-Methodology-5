## Brainstorming

1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
    -  We learned how to mitigate bias during EDA, model development, and evaluation stages. Tools like AIF360 were introduced to address fairness. These concepts help us understand how to make models more transparent and accountable.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
    - I would explore biases in language processing, focusing on demographic bias. This could involve analyzing how certain groups are unfairly represented in social media.
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
    - I would make the notebook more narrative by adding detailed explanations. Including more writing can improve clarity and help better document our methods. I would also allocate time to learn advanced techniques.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
    - I would like to use word embedding for deeper text understanding. Sentiment analysis is another technique I want to explore for its practical applications.
